# 🛡️BlockDefend-AI

This project proposes a blockchain-based cybersecurity threat intelligence (CTI) and situational awareness system 
for accurate intrusion alert prediction, leveraging the strengths of both technologies to provide a robust defense 
mechanism. Blockchain technology ensures secure, tamper-proof data storage, while machine learning models enhance 
detection efficiency through advanced pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

The system utilizes a hybrid approach, combining a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier optimized by Particle 
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for training data at first then, proceded with feature selection performed through Mutual Information (MI) 
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for more accuracy.

Furthermore, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with batch normalization is employed for intrusion prediction, 
enabling the system to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data.

By integrating blockchain and deep learning, the system improves threat detection accuracy, providing real-time 
alerts and better protection against cyber-attacks, while also enabling the secure sharing of threat intelligence 
across organizations and industries.
